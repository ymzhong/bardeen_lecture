# bardeen_lecture
latex typesetting Bardeen's classical lecture on cosmological perturbations. 

The article ["Cosmological Perturbations From Quantum Fluctuations To Large Scale Structure"](http://inspirehep.net/record/271685?ln=en) is originally published in [Cosmology and particle physics. Proceedings, CCAST (World Laboratory) Symposium/Workshop, Nanjing, P.R. China, June 30 - July 12, 1988](http://inspirehep.net/record/273300).

An appendix is added to show the difference in conventions between Bardeen, Dodelson, and Mukhanov.
