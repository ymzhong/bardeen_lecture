# bardeen_lecture
Typesetting James M. Bardeen's classical lecture on cosmological perturbations in latex (with JHEP template). 

The article ["Cosmological Perturbations From Quantum Fluctuations To Large Scale Structure"](http://inspirehep.net/record/271685?ln=en) is originally published in [Proceedings of CCAST (World Laboratory) Symposium/Workshop 1988](http://inspirehep.net/record/273300) (edited by Li-Zhi Fang and Anthony Zee).

An appendix is added to show the differences in conventions of Bardeen, Mukhanov, and Dodelson.
